# Getting and Cleaning Data

##In this repo you will find my Data and Clening Course Project.

###The origin files can be found in the following link: 

[Data for the project](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

###The files that you will find in this project are the following:

-Code Book.md: In this file you will be able to find all the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

-run_analysis.R: In this file you will find the scrip that makes possible to transform the original Data to a Tidy Data. The script does the following:

      1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      
      2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
      
      3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      
      4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
      
      5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

-tidydata.txt: This file is the result of the script run_analisys.R
